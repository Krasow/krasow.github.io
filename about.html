                        My research introduction began with research within the FTHPC group at Clemson University under Dr. Jon C. Calhoun. 
                        Within this group, I collaborated with Argonne National Laboratory as a visiting student on lossy data compression research.
                        Our goal was to determine different statistical predictions that would allow for estimation of lossy compression ratios. This had lead to 
                        <a href="index#publications">publications</a> and <a href="news">awards</a>.
                        I participated in the Student Cluster Competition at Super Computing (SC) ’21. I had to manage resource allocations to achieve highest benchmark scores on HPL[1] and
                        run scientific applications, i.e. Quantum Espresso[2], with large problems without going over the given monetary budget. These applications took hours to complete using tens
                        of nodes configured with MPI. Also, I participated in the INDYSCC at SC '22 with our team winning best poster.
                        I recently have started at Northwestern under Dr. Peter Dinda and have interest in data centric computing for domain specific applications.

                        The end of Moore’s law has resulted in development of new specialized architectures for computing [3]. There has been countless prior work in the area of increasing computational 
                        speed using processing in/near memory (PIM) accelerators. However, there are a few issues that require a demanding amount of work for adoption for these newer ideas. 
                        This is due to the general approach taken and requiring domain scientists to rewrite their code with directives in order to make use of this functionality. 
                        <br><br>
                        I have an interest in designing a PIM system for HPC domain specific applications. I would like to focus on HPC infrastructures; however, this approach would 
                        generalize to other infrastructures, such as data centers. Data centers are used all over the world and utilize lots of valuable resources/energy. 
                        Improving data center architecture and programmability can reduce the environmental footprint. Northwestern has multiple labs working towards the goal of optimizing 
                        performance in computing systems. I am currently working with the Prescience lab that focuses on optimizing higher level code to reduce programmer intervention. 
                        My goal is to take high level languages that are popular within a specific domain and automatically detect parallel code to generate PIM instructions. 
                        Using today’s PIM hardware, I expect to be able to develop a software approach to achieve this goal. I can leverage my group's compiler and language expertise in pursuit of the goal. 
                        This approach would allow domain scientists to keep their high level code and not spend time rewriting it for the new system. Based on my experience in the software approach, 
                        I will next consider improvements to hardware design. This plan will hopefully lead to increased performance and allow for less energy consumption, 
                        thus improving efficiency and environmental impact.
